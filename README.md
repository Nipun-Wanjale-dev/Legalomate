## 🌟 The Vision
Navigating city zoning and building codes is a nightmare for most homeowners. With 500-page rulebooks and endless red tape, many give up before they even start. **Legalomate** cuts through the noise. It doesn't just search for laws—it understands them, translates them, and guides you with the precision of a world-class legal assistant.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Elite Sign-In Experience:** A secure, high-end "Gatekeeper" entrance that sets the tone for a premium user journey.
* **Autonomous Legal Agent:** Legalomate uses the **Gemini 3 Search Tool** to independently find, download, and index municipal documents—no manual uploading required.
* **Flash-Speed Assistance:** Near-instant answers to complex legal questions powered by **Gemini 3 Flash**.
* **Multimodal Site Vision:** Upload a photo of your property, and **Gemini 3 Pro** analyzes the physical space against local setback and height laws.
* **The Error Shield:** Smart, gold-accented alerts that catch mistakes in plain English, ensuring your project stays on the "Golden Path."

## 🧠 Technical Architecture

Legalomate maximizes the **Gemini 3 Family** to balance speed and deep reasoning:

| Feature | Engine | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Document Retrieval** | Gemini 3 Search API | To autonomously fetch live municipal data and legislative updates. |
| **Legal Chatbot** | Gemini 3 Flash | Provides lightning-fast responses with minimal latency. |
| **Visual Analysis** | Gemini 3 Pro | Leverages native multimodality to "see" property constraints. |
| **Context Logic** | Context Caching | We utilize implicit caching for the 2M+ token window so the law is "remembered" instantly. |
